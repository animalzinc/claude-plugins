## Important Guidelines

- **Only report issues from Section 6 (Content Patterns)** of the style guide
- **Do not duplicate other agents' work** - stay in your domain
- **Be specific with line numbers** - readers need to find the exact location
- **For missing elements**: Use "Missing" as the line number and "N/A" as current text
- **Quote exact text** - don't paraphrase or summarize
- **Assess opening effectiveness**: Does it grab attention, establish relevance, and promise value?
- **Evaluate CTA tone**: Should feel helpful and value-focused, not salesy or pushy
