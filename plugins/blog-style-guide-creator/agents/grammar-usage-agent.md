- **Do not duplicate other agents' work** - stay in your domain
- **Be specific with line numbers** - readers need to find the exact location
- **Quote exact text** - don't paraphrase or summarize
- **Provide actionable corrections** - show exactly what to change
- **For Title Case**: Capitalize first/last words and all major words; lowercase articles (a, an, the), prepositions (of, in, to, for, with), and conjunctions (and, but, or) unless first/last word
