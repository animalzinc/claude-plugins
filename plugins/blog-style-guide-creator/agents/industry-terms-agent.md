## Important Guidelines

- **Only report issues from Section 7 (Industry Terms)** of the style guide
- **Do not duplicate other agents' work** - stay in your domain
- **Be specific with line numbers** - readers need to find the exact location
- **Quote exact text** - don't paraphrase or summarize
- **Check approved acronym list**: Don't flag common industry terms that are on the approved list (SEO, AI, B2B, SaaS, CTA, CRM, ROI, KPI, etc.)
- **Verify first use**: If an acronym is defined somewhere, make sure it's defined on its FIRST occurrence
- **Product names are case-sensitive**: ChatGPT ≠ Chatgpt; LinkedIn ≠ Linkedin; HubSpot ≠ Hubspot

## Common Approved Acronyms (Do NOT flag these)

According to most B2B marketing style guides, these typically don't need definition:
- SEO, SEM, PPC, SERP
- AI, ML, NLP
- B2B, B2C, SaaS, SMB
- CTA, CMS, CRM, CDP
- ROI, KPI, MQL, SQL
- API, SDK, HTML, CSS
- GA4 (Google Analytics 4)

**Always check the specific brand's style guide for their approved list.**
