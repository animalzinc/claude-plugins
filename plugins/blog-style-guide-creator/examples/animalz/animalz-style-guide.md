## 1. Voice & Tone

### 1.1 Core Principles

Animalz content is **professional yet conversational** — approachable expertise that respects the reader's intelligence while maintaining warmth and authenticity.

**Key characteristics:**
- Expert without being academic
- Conversational without being casual
- Confident without being arrogant
- Personal without being overly familiar

---

### 1.2 Active Voice Preference

**Rule:** Use active voice 95%+ of the time.

**Why:** Active voice is clearer, more direct, and more engaging.

✅ **Do:** "We analyzed 18 articles to identify patterns."
❌ **Don't:** "18 articles were analyzed to identify patterns."

✅ **Do:** "Content marketers face this challenge daily."
❌ **Don't:** "This challenge is faced daily by content marketers."

**Exception:** Passive voice is acceptable when the actor is unknown or unimportant, or when you want to emphasize the action over the actor.

---

### 1.3 Person (You/We/I Usage)

**Rule:** Use natural, authentic voice that creates connection with readers. In bylined articles, first-person singular ("I") is preferred for personal authenticity.

**Use "you" for:**
- Direct instruction and advice
- Addressing reader pain points
- Creating engagement

**Examples:**
- "You'll find this pattern across successful blogs."
- "When you're stuck on blank page syndrome..."

**Use "I" for:**
- Personal experiences and perspectives in bylined articles
- Authentic, relatable storytelling
- Individual recommendations and insights
- Creating genuine connection with readers

**Examples:**
- "I use it daily for content audits and reporting."
- "I suggest starting with your highest-traffic pages."
- "When I first encountered this problem..."

**Use "we" for:**
- Organizational/team statements and findings
- Shared company expertise (when speaking for Animalz as a whole)
- Collaborative work or research

**Examples:**
- "We analyzed 1,000 blog posts to find this pattern."
- "At Animalz, we've found that organic search drives the most growth."

**Avoid:**
- Third person when second or first person is more direct
- "One" as a pronoun (too formal)
- Switching between "I" and "we" inconsistently within the same article
- Using "we" when "I" would be more honest and authentic

---

### 1.4 Contractions

**Rule:** Use contractions freely to maintain conversational tone.

✅ **Always use:** we're, you'll, it's, don't, can't, isn't, won't, they're, we've

❌ **Avoid writing out:** we are, you will, it is, do not, cannot, is not, will not (except for emphasis)

**Example for emphasis:**
"This is not just another content framework — it's a complete system."

---

### 1.5 Formality Level

**Rule:** Professional but conversational. Industry jargon is acceptable when writing for our B2B audience.

**Use:**
- Rhetorical questions
- Metaphors and analogies
- Personal anecdotes (when relevant)
- Direct address to reader

**Avoid:**
- Academic tone or overly complex sentence structures
- Unnecessary jargon or buzzwords
- Condescending language
- Overly casual slang (unless strategically deployed)

---

## 2. Grammar & Usage

### 2.1 Oxford Comma

**Rule:** ALWAYS use the Oxford (serial) comma.

✅ **Correct:** "We analyzed grammar, punctuation, and formatting."
❌ **Incorrect:** "We analyzed grammar, punctuation and formatting."

**No exceptions.** This rule is 100% consistent across all Animalz content.

---

### 2.2 Capitalization

#### 2.2.1 Article Titles

**Rule:** Use Title Case for all article titles.

**Title Case means:**
- Capitalize first and last words
- Capitalize major words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs)
- Lowercase articles (a, an, the)
- Lowercase prepositions (of, in, to, for, with, etc.) unless first/last word
- Lowercase conjunctions (and, but, or) unless first/last word

✅ **Examples:**
- "How to Write a Case Study That Closes Deals"
- "The Complete Guide to Content Marketing"
- "SEO vs. AEO: A Field Guide for B2B Marketers"

---

#### 2.2.2 Headings (H1, H2, H3)

**Rule:** Use Title Case for ALL heading levels.

✅ **Correct:**
- H1: "The Animalz Method for Writing High-Quality Content"
- H2: "Why Content Marketing Drives Growth"
- H3: "Find Your Content Competitors"

❌ **Incorrect:**
- H2: "Why content marketing drives growth" (sentence case)
- H3: "find your content competitors" (lowercase)

---

#### 2.2.3 Product and Company Names

**Rule:** Follow brand-standard capitalization exactly.

**Examples:**
- Animalz (not animalz or ANIMALZ)
- ChatGPT (not Chatgpt or chatGPT)
- LinkedIn (not Linkedin)
- HubSpot (not Hubspot)
- X (formerly Twitter)

**When in doubt:** Check the company's official website or brand guidelines.

---

### 2.3 Hyphenation

#### 2.3.1 Compound Modifiers

**Rule:** Hyphenate compound modifiers when they appear before a noun.

✅ **Examples:**
- "high-quality content"
- "data-driven approach"
- "long-form research"
- "well-researched article"
- "AI-generated content"

❌ **Don't hyphenate after the noun:**
- "The content is high quality." (not "high-quality")
- "Our approach is data driven." (not "data-driven")

---

#### 2.3.2 Prefixes

**Rule:** Follow standard English conventions — most prefixes don't take hyphens.

**No hyphen:**
- re- words: rebuild, rethink, rewrite (unless followed by capital letter: re-establish Re-Tweet)
- pre- words: prelaunch, preorder
- post- words: postlaunch, postpandemic
- co- words: coauthor, cofounder

**Use hyphen:**
- non- prefix: non-promotional, non-competitive
- When prefix precedes capitalized word: pre-COVID, non-SEO
- When needed for clarity: re-sign (sign again) vs. resign (quit)

---

### 2.4 Numbers

#### 2.4.1 When to Spell Out vs. Use Numerals

**Rule:** Spell out numbers one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.

✅ **Examples:**
- "three main strategies"
- "one clear winner"
- "15 actionable tactics"
- "127 companies"

**Always use numerals for:**
- Percentages: "3%", "70%", "99%"
- Statistics and data: "5.92% growth rate"
- Measurements: "1,200 words", "3 minutes"
- Dates: "September 24, 2025"
- Years: "2021", "2024"
- Money: "$7 million"
- Ages: "5 years old"
- Time: "10 minutes", "3:00 PM"

**Always spell out:**
- Numbers starting a sentence: "Fifteen experts contributed..."
- Casual/literary usage: "a thousand different roads"

---

### 2.5 Abbreviations and Acronyms

**Rule:** Common industry acronyms do not require spelling out on first use. Newer or less common terms should be defined.

**No definition needed (assume reader knowledge):**
- SEO, SEM, PPC
- AI, ML
- B2B, B2C, SaaS
- CTA, CMS, CRM
- ROI, KPI

**Define on first use:**
- Emerging tools/technologies: "Google Analytics 4 (GA4)"
- Internal frameworks: "Return on Content Spend (ROCS)"
- Specialized terms: "compound monthly growth rate (CMGR)"

**Format:** Spell out, then acronym in parentheses, then use acronym for all subsequent mentions.

---

## 3. Punctuation

### 3.1 Em Dashes

**Rule:** Use em dashes (—) for emphasis, interruption, or to set off explanatory phrases. Always include spaces before and after.

✅ **Correct:** "Content marketing — when done right — drives measurable growth."
❌ **Incorrect:** "Content marketing—when done right—drives measurable growth." (no spaces)

**When to use em dashes:**
- To add emphasis or drama
- To set off a parenthetical phrase (alternative to parentheses)
- To show interruption or change of thought

**Examples:**
- "We analyzed 18 articles — spanning five years — to identify patterns."
- "The results were clear — quality trumps quantity."

**How to type:** macOS: Option + Shift + Hyphen | Windows: Alt + 0151 | Or type two hyphens (--) and your word processor may auto-convert

---

### 3.2 Quotation Marks

**Rule:** Use American style — double quotes as primary, with punctuation inside closing quotes.

✅ **Correct:** She said, "Content marketing drives growth."
❌ **Incorrect:** She said, "Content marketing drives growth".

**Use single quotes for:**
- Quotes within quotes: He said, "She told me 'content is king' repeatedly."
- Scare quotes or ironic emphasis (sparingly): The 'revolutionary' approach was just basic SEO.

**Always:**
- Commas and periods go inside closing quotes
- Colons and semicolons go outside closing quotes
- Question marks/exclamation points go inside if part of the quote, outside if not

---

### 3.3 Colons

**Rule:** Use colons to introduce lists, explanations, or elaborations.

**Examples:**
- "We found three key patterns: consistency, clarity, and engagement."
- "The strategy is simple: create content people want to share."

**After a colon:**
- Lowercase if what follows is a fragment or single sentence
- Capitalize if what follows is multiple sentences or a formal statement

---

### 3.4 Semicolons

**Rule:** Use rarely. Prefer em dashes or separate sentences.

**When to use (if at all):**
- To connect closely related independent clauses
- To separate complex list items that already contain commas

**Better alternatives:**
- Em dash: "We analyzed the data — the results were clear."
- Two sentences: "We analyzed the data. The results were clear."

---

### 3.5 Ellipses

**Rule:** Use sparingly for trailing thoughts or to indicate omitted text in quotes.

**Format:** Three dots (...) with no spaces between

**Examples:**
- Trailing thought: "There are so many content marketing tactics..."
- Omitted text in quote: "Content marketing [... ] drives growth when done consistently."

---

### 3.6 List Punctuation

**Rule:** Grammar-based approach.

**Complete sentences → use periods:**
- First item is a complete sentence.
- Second item is also a complete sentence.
- Third item follows the pattern.

**Fragments → no periods:**
- First item
- Second item
- Third item

**Mixed lists (some complete, some fragments) → use periods for all items for consistency**

---

## 4. Formatting

### 4.1 Headings

**Hierarchy:**
- **H1:** Article title only (one per article)
- **H2:** Main section headings
- **H3:** Subsections within H2s
- **H4:** Rarely used; only for deep nesting if absolutely necessary

**Capitalization:** Title Case for all levels (see 2.2.2)

**Numbering:** Context-dependent
- ✅ Use numbered headings when article title promises a numbered framework
  - Example: "10 Ways to Improve SEO" → H2s should be "1. First Way", "2. Second Way", etc.
- ❌ Don't number headings for standard articles without numbered frameworks

---

### 4.2 Lists

**Bulleted lists:** For non-sequential items

**Numbered lists:** For sequential steps or ranked items

**Formatting:**
- Introduce lists with a colon
- Use parallel structure (all items start with same part of speech)
- Apply punctuation rules from section 3.6

**Example of parallel structure:**

✅ **Good:**
- Analyze your competitors
- Research your audience
- Develop your strategy

❌ **Bad:**
- Analyzing competitors
- Research your audience
- Strategy development

---

### 4.3 Bold and Italics

**Bold:** Use for emphasis on key concepts, takeaways, or CTAs

**Examples:**
- "**Always use the Oxford comma.**"
- "The key insight: **quality trumps quantity.**"
- "**Ready to transform your content strategy? Let's talk.**"

**Italics:** Use for subtle emphasis, book/publication titles, or specific terms being defined

**Examples:**
- "Writing is _mostly_ thinking."
- "We recommend reading _Content Inc._"
- "The concept of _movement-first content_ emerged in 2018."

**Don't:**
- Overuse either (diminishes impact)
- Use both on the same text
- Use for entire paragraphs

---

### 4.4 Hyperlinks

**Rule:** Use descriptive anchor text. Avoid generic phrases.

✅ **Good:**
- "Read our complete guide to content marketing"
- "Download the 2024 Content Benchmark Report"
- "Learn more about organic link-building"

❌ **Bad:**
- "Click here for our guide"
- "Read more"
- "Download here"

**Best practices:**
- Link naturally within sentences
- Make link text descriptive of destination
- Don't overload articles with links (diminishes value)
- Internal links: Same tab
- External links: Use judgment based on user experience

---

### 4.5 Image Captions

**Rule:** Use sentence case, descriptive captions. Include period if caption is a complete sentence.

**Examples:**
- "Content marketing performance over 5 years."
- "Monthly organic traffic growth by industry"

**Best practices:**
- Keep captions concise (one sentence preferred)
- Describe what's shown, not just repeat the heading
- Include attribution when necessary: "Source: Animalz Benchmark Report 2024"

---

## 5. Technical Standards

### 5.1 Dates

**Rule:** Month Day, Year (no ordinal suffixes)

✅ **Correct:** September 24, 2025
❌ **Incorrect:** September 24th, 2025

**Other date formats:**
- Month + Year only: "September 2025"
- Year ranges: "2021-2025" or "2021 to 2025"

**Days of week:** Spell out (Monday, not Mon.)

**Months:** Spell out in body text; abbreviate in tight spaces (charts/tables): Jan., Feb., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.

---

### 5.2 Time

**Rule:** Use numerals with lowercase "am" and "pm" (no periods)

✅ **Examples:**
- "9am EST"
- "3:30pm"
- "The webinar runs from 10am to 11:30am"

**Spell out for:**
- Casual references: "We met in the morning"
- Approximate times: "around noon"

---

### 5.3 Percentages

**Rule:** Numeral + % symbol, no space

✅ **Correct:** 70%, 3%, 99.5%
❌ **Incorrect:** 70 %, 3 percent, ninety-nine percent

**Decimals:** Use when precision matters: "5.92% growth rate"

**Rounding:** Round to whole numbers for readability unless precision is essential

---

### 5.4 Read Time Indicators

**Rule:** Numeral + "min" (no period)

✅ **Format:** "8 min", "12 min", "3 min"

**Placement:** In byline metadata with author name and date

**Example:** "Tim Metz • 8 min • September 24, 2025"

---

### 5.5 Currency

**Rule:** Use symbol + numeral; spell out large numbers

✅ **Examples:**
- "$50"
- "$7 million" (not "$7,000,000")
- "$4.5 billion"

**For exact large numbers:** Use commas: "$127,000"

---

## 6. Content Patterns

### 6.1 Article Titles

**Length:** 7-15 words (target)

**Structure options (in order of preference):**
1. **Direct statement:** "Content Strategy Drives B2B Growth"
2. **With colon:** "Content Marketing: A Complete Framework"
3. **With parenthetical:** "Building Your Content Strategy (Without the Guesswork)"
4. **How-to format:** "How to Build a Data-Driven Content Strategy"

**Title Case:** Always (see 2.2.1)

**SEO considerations:**
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Front-load important terms
- Make the value proposition clear

**What works:**
- Specific promises
- Numbers (when authentic)
- Clear benefits
- Intriguing questions

**What to avoid:**
- Clickbait
- Vague promises
- ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Overly clever titles that obscure meaning

---

### 6.2 Article Openings

**Structure:** Hook → Problem/Context → Promise

**First paragraph goals:**
- Grab attention (relatable scenario, bold statement, question)
- Establish relevance (why reader should care)
- Promise value (what they'll learn/gain)

**Examples of effective hooks:**

**Relatable scenario:**
"Every content marketer knows this moment: You've published 50 blog posts, invested thousands of dollars, and you still can't prove ROI to your CEO."

**Bold statement:**
"Content marketing benchmarks are lying to you."

**Provocative question:**
"What if everything you know about SEO is about to change?"

**Keep it short:** First paragraph should be 2-4 sentences maximum.

---

### 6.3 Calls-to-Action (CTAs)

**Default style:** Soft, value-focused

**Format:**
- Lead with value proposition or question
- Clear, specific action
- Remove friction (don't ask for too much)

✅ **Examples:**
- "Want more insights like this? Subscribe to our newsletter."
- "Get our complete content marketing guide delivered to your inbox."
- "Ready to transform your content strategy? Let's talk about how we can help."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Click here to sign up now!!!"
- "Don't miss out on this opportunity"
- Multiple competing CTAs

**Placement:**
- Primary CTA: End of article
- Secondary CTA: Sidebar or embedded (if relevant)
- Newsletter signup: Consistent across all articles

**Tone:** Match article voice — conversational, not pushy

---

### 6.4 Bylines and Author Bios

**Byline format:** Author Name • Read Time • Date

**Example:** "Tim Metz • 8 min • September 24, 2025"

**Author bio:**
- 2-3 sentences
- Relevant expertise/credentials
- Link to author LinkedIn or Twitter
- Professional but approachable tone

---
