5. **Conclusion:** Synthesize key points and suggest next steps or implications

### Heading Hierarchy
- **H1:** Article title only (one per article)

- **H4:** Rarely used; only for detailed breakdowns within subsections

### Paragraph Structure
- Keep paragraphs focused on a single idea
- Aim for 3-5 sentences per paragraph

## 4. Technical Content Standards

### Code Examples
- Always include context for code snippets
- Use proper syntax highlighting
- Provide comments for complex operations
- Test all code examples before publication
- Include language identifiers in code blocks

### Technical Terminology
- **Consistency:** Use the same term throughout an article (don't alternate between "model" and "LLM" randomly)
- **Precision:** Choose the most accurate term (neural network vs. deep learning vs. machine learning)
- **Definition:** Define specialized terms on first use
- **Audience-appropriate:** Adjust technical depth to target audience

### Data & Statistics
- Always cite sources for statistics and research findings
- Use recent data (prefer sources from last 2 years when possible)

## 5. SEO & Discoverability

### Keyword Usage
- Integrate keywords naturally into the narrative
- Use primary keyword in H1, first paragraph, and at least one H2

### Meta Elements
- **Title tags:** 50-60 characters, include primary keyword
- **Meta descriptions:** 150-160 characters, compelling and informative
- **URL slugs:** Short, descriptive, include primary keyword

### Internal Linking
- Link to related articles naturally within content
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Include 2-4 internal links per article

## 6. Citations & Attribution

### Source Citation
- **Academic sources:** Include author, publication, year in text; full citation at end
- **News articles:** Link directly in text with publication name
- **Research papers:** Include title and publication venue
- **Company sources:** Attribute clearly (e.g., "According to OpenAI's documentation...")

### Link Practices
- Link to primary sources when possible
- Verify all links are functional before publication
- Use nofollow tags appropriately for sponsored or untrusted content
- Open external links in new tabs (when platform allows)

### Attribution Style
- Introduce quotes with attribution ("According to...", "As X noted...")
- Use block quotes for longer quotations (3+ lines)
- Paraphrase with attribution when direct quotes aren't necessary
- Clearly distinguish between facts, opinions, and speculation

## 7. Word Choice & Style Preferences

### Preferred Terms
- **AI model** (not "artificial intelligence model" repeatedly)
- **Large language model (LLM)** on first use, then "LLM" or "model"
- **Machine learning** (not "ML" unless in technical context)
- **Training data** (not "data set" as two words)
- **Open-source** (hyphenated as adjective)
- **Real-time** (hyphenated as adjective, two words as noun)

### Avoid
- Overused buzzwords without substance ("game-changing," "revolutionary" without evidence)
- Anthropomorphizing AI ("the model thinks," "AI wants")—instead use "processes," "generates," "predicts"
- Hyperbolic claims about AI capabilities
- Unexplained jargon or acronyms
- Passive voice when active is clearer

### Inclusive Language
- Use gender-neutral language (they/them for singular generic reference)
- Avoid assumptions about reader's technical background
- Use "we" inclusively when discussing industry or user community
- Consider accessibility in examples and scenarios
