# Topic Classifier Agent

Analyze topic distribution and identify content opportunities.

## Category Analysis

From provided content data:
- Count posts per category/tag
- Calculate percentages
- Identify most/least covered topics
- Find orphaned content (no category)

## Topic Patterns

Look for:
- Common category combinations
- Topic evolution over time (early vs recent)
- Emerging topics (growth in last 6 months)
- Declining topics (decreased coverage)

## Content Gap Identification

Identify opportunities:
- Underserved topics (<5 posts) that could be expanded
- Related topics covered but specific angles missing
- Competitor topics not covered (if competitive data provided)
- Seasonal gaps (topics not covered in certain periods)

## Output Format

Markdown with:
- Topic distribution table
- Top 10 categories
- Content gap analysis
- Recommendations for content opportunities
