# Examples

## Example 1: Landing page hero section

**Scenario:** A project management tool launching an AI-powered scheduling feature. Need hero copy for the feature landing page.

**Command:**
```bash
/copywrite ai-scheduler-hero
```

### Phase 1: Brief

```
**[Phase 1/7: Brief | Strict]**

What are we making?
```

> Landing page — hero section (headline + subhead + CTA).

```
Who sees this? Not a demographic — a person in a moment.
```

> Sarah, a project manager at a 200-person SaaS company. She just spent
> 45 minutes rescheduling three meetings because one stakeholder moved
> a call. She's on the product's pricing page after a Google search for
> "AI meeting scheduler."

```
Good — I can see Sarah. What's she feeling right now?
```

> Frustrated. Resentful of the busywork. Skeptical that another tool
> will actually help.

```
Attitude shift?
```

> Point A: "Scheduling is a tax I pay for having a team."
> Point B: "I never have to think about scheduling again."

### Phase 2: Strategy

```
**[Phase 2/7: Strategy | Strict]**

What's the truest thing about this product?
```

> It actually watches calendar patterns and reschedules conflicts
> before you notice them.

```
Could Calendly put that on their website?
```

> ...probably not. They schedule meetings. They don't preemptively
> resolve conflicts.

```
That's your core truth: it acts before the problem exists. What's
the SOCO?
```

> "Your calendar manages itself."

```
The SOCO contains no "and," no comma, one idea. Passes.
```

### Phase 4: Exploration (excerpt)

After 12 human variants:

```
**[Phase 4/7: Exploration | Strict]**

You've got 12. They all lead with "never" or "stop" — the relief
angle. That's one direction. Where are the other directions?
```

After 18 variants spanning three angles (relief, magic, reclaimed time):

```
You've done strong work here. I see "magic" and "reclaimed time" as
your strongest directions. Want me to generate 5-10 more riffing on
those?
```

### Phase 5: Selection (excerpt)

| # | Variant | Visualize? | Falsify? | Nobody else? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | "Your calendar fixed itself while you were in the meeting" | Y | Y | Y |
| 16 | "Stop scheduling. Start showing up." | N | N | N |
| 22 | "3 meetings rescheduled before your coffee got cold" | Y | Y | Y |

Variants 14 and 22 pass all three laws. Variant 16 fails all three — too abstract, unfalsifiable, any calendar tool could claim it.

## Example 2: Ad headline (billboard)

**Scenario:** A premium coffee subscription. Billboard near a highway exit. 5 words maximum.

**Command:**
```bash
/copywrite coffee-billboard
```

### Phase 2: Strategy

```
Core truth?
```

> They roast to order on the day they ship. Most subscription coffee
> was roasted weeks ago.

```
SOCO?
```

> "Roasted the day it ships."

### Phase 4: Exploration with Sullivan lenses

After 8 variants all focused on freshness:

```
**[Phase 4/7: Exploration | Strict]**

You're stuck on "fresh." Try inverting it — what's the opposite claim?
```

> "Your coffee is already stale." → leads to: "Stale by Tuesday.
> Ours isn't."

```
Try passage of time — what's different in a week?
```

> "Day 1 vs. Day 14" → leads to: "Roasted today. In your cup
> tomorrow."

### Phase 5: Money Words check

- **"Roasted today. In your cup tomorrow."** — Passes You Rule (implied "your"). No "and." No "pay." Not a category cliché (competitors say "fresh" and "artisan," not "today/tomorrow").
- **"Stale by Tuesday. Ours isn't."** — Falsifiable (you could test it). Nobody else would dare say "stale." But fails the You Rule — "ours" makes the brand the subject.

## Example 3: Email subject line

**Scenario:** Product launch email for a design tool's new collaboration feature. Sent to existing free-tier users.

**Command:**
```bash
/copywrite collab-launch-email
```

### Phase 2: Strategy

```
SOCO?
```

> "Design together without the chaos."

```
That contains an implied "and" — "together" + "without chaos" is two
ideas. Which matters more to free-tier users?
```

> The chaos. They're already designing together — badly.

```
New SOCO: "No more design chaos."
```

### Phase 5: Money Words analysis

| Subject line | You Rule | Get test | And check | Interference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| "Your design files just got organized" | Yes (your) | Yes (got) | Clean | "organized" is generic |
| "Stop emailing screenshots to your team" | Yes (your) | No | Clean | Specific and concrete |
| "Get real-time design collaboration" | No (feature) | Yes (get) | Clean | "real-time" and "collaboration" are category clichés |

Winner: **"Stop emailing screenshots to your team"** — falsifiable (people actually do this), visualizable (you can picture the email with attached PNGs), and nobody else would frame it this specifically.

## Common workflows

### Quick tagline sprint
Use Phases 1-5 only. Phase 6 is often unnecessary for taglines — the selected finalist from Phase 5 is the deliverable. Skip straight to Phase 7 for final polish.

### Full landing page
All 7 phases. Phase 6 expands to cover hero, value proposition sections, social proof, and CTA. Budget 2-3 sessions.

### A/B test variant generation
Focus on Phase 4 volume. Generate 20+ variants, then use Phase 5 to systematically evaluate which ones to test. The three-laws table becomes your A/B test selection criteria.
