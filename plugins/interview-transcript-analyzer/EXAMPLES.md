## Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full Analysis Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Initial analysis
/analyze-interviews q1-research ./interviews/ --context-file ./icp.md

# 2. Extract quotes for top theme
/extract-quotes "pricing concerns" ./interviews/

# 3. Re-rank by impact
/rank-insights analysis/q1-research-analysis.md --criteria impact

# 4. Get more quotes on #1 ranked theme
/extract-quotes "enterprise features" ./interviews/ --max-quotes 15
```

---

### Workflow 2: Competitive Research

```bash
# Analyze competitor user interviews
/analyze-interviews competitive-intel ./competitor-research/

# Extract quotes about specific competitor
/extract-quotes "switching from [Competitor X]" ./competitor-research/

# Rank by strategic value
/rank-insights analysis/competitive-intel-analysis.md --criteria "competitive urgency"
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Getting Better Theme Extraction

**‚úÖ Do:**
- Include diverse interviews (different user types, use cases)
- Provide ICP document for relevance filtering
- Use consistent interview structure across sessions

**‚ùå Don't:**
- Mix customer types (B2B and B2C) in one analysis
- Include off-topic conversations
- Forget to de-identify sensitive information

### Quote Quality

**For presentations:** Use quotes scored 8-10

**For reports:** Quotes 6-10 work well

**For context:** Lower-scored quotes still useful for understanding

### Agent Scaling

**System decides automatically, but you can:**
- Request more agents for very large datasets (30+)
- Request fewer agents if system resources limited
- Split very large datasets into batches (analyze separately, then compare)

---

## Real-World Results

**Time Savings:**
- Manual analysis: 1-2 hours per transcript = 12-24 hours for 12 interviews
- With plugin: 15 minutes total
- **Speedup: 48-96x faster**

**Quality Improvements:**
- Catches patterns across all transcripts (humans might miss cross-cutting themes)
- Consistent scoring and ranking
- No recency bias (later interviews don't overshadow earlier ones)
