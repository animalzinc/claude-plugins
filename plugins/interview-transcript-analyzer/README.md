## Intelligent Agent Scaling

The plugin automatically determines optimal agent count:

|-------------|--------|--------|------|
| 1-3 | Any | 1 | 5-10 min |
| 4-8 | <150k | 3 | 10-15 min |
| 4-8 | >150k | 5 | 10-15 min |
| 9-15 | Any | 5 | 15-20 min |
| 16+ | Any | 8 | 20-30 min |

**You're always asked to approve** the strategy before processing begins.
