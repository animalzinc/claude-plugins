# Re-Rank Insights

Re-rank insights from a previous analysis using different criteria (frequency, impact, relevance, or custom).

## Step 1: Load Previous Analysis

**Read the analysis file ($1):**
- Parse all themes/insights from the file
- Extract frequency data
- Note any existing rankings

**Report to user:**
```markdown
## üìä Analysis Loaded

**File:** $1
**Themes found:** [number]
**Current ranking:** [Current criteria if specified]

**Available themes:**
1. [Theme name] - Currently ranked #1
2. [Theme name] - Currently ranked #2
[etc.]

How would you like to re-rank these insights?
```

---

## Step 2: Select Ranking Criteria

**Present options to user:**
```markdown
## üéØ Ranking Criteria Options

Choose how to rank insights:

1. **Frequency** - Most mentioned themes first
   - Best for: Understanding what came up most often
   - Data available: ‚úÖ

2. **Impact** - Highest impact/severity first
   - Best for: Prioritizing what to act on
   - Requires: Manual input or impact assessment

3. **Relevance to ICP** - Best fit with ideal customer profile
   - Best for: Focusing on target audience needs
   - Requires: ICP document for comparison

4. **Business Value** - Revenue/strategic opportunity size
   - Best for: ROI-focused prioritization
   - Requires: Business context assessment

5. **Ease of Implementation** - Quick wins first
   - Best for: Tactical planning
   - Requires: Feasibility assessment

6. **Custom** - Provide your own criteria
   - Example: "Rank by technical complexity" or "Rank by customer segment"

Which criteria would you like to use? [1-6 or describe custom]
```

**Wait for user selection.**

---

## Step 3: Apply Ranking Criteria

Based on user's choice:

### If Frequency (Option 1):
- Simply re-sort themes by mention count
- No additional analysis needed

### If Impact (Option 2):
Use the **insight-ranker** agent to:
- Review each theme
- Assess potential impact (pain point severity, opportunity size)
- Rank accordingly

### If Relevance to ICP (Option 3):
**Ask for ICP document:**
```
Please provide path to your ICP document, or I'll look for:
- icp.md
- ideal-customer-profile.md
- customer-profile.md
in the analysis directory
```

Then use **insight-ranker** agent to:
- Read ICP document
- Score each theme by alignment with ICP characteristics
- Rank by relevance score

### If Business Value (Option 4):
**Prompt user for context:**
```
To rank by business value, I need to understand:
1. Revenue impact indicators (which themes suggest upsell/retention opportunities?)
2. Strategic priorities (which align with company goals?)

Please provide:
- Business goals document, OR
- Quick description of strategic priorities

Or I can make best-effort assessment based on theme content.
```

### If Custom (Option 6):
**Ask user to clarify:**
```
Please describe your custom ranking criteria:
Example: "Rank by technical complexity, easiest first"
Example: "Rank by enterprise vs SMB relevance"
Example: "Rank by urgency based on competitive pressure"
```

Then use **insight-ranker** agent with custom instructions.

**Previous rank:** #[old position]

**Moved down:**

## Next Steps

Would you like to:
1. Save this new ranking to file (updates original or creates new)
2. Compare rankings side-by-side (original vs new)
3. Try different criteria
4. Export top 3 insights as summary
```

## Step 5: Save or Export (Optional)
